# 🦔 AI Nuggets

Personalized podcasts curated and narrated by **Nigel**, an AI assistant.
Each show under `podcasts/<slug>/` is a separate feed for a separate audience.

## Shows

| Slug | Audience | Subscribe |
|---|---|---|
| [`biomedical-agentic-ai`](podcasts/biomedical-agentic-ai/) | Andrew Su (Su Lab, Scripps) — agentic AI applied to biomedical research | [feed.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewsu/ai-nuggets/main/feed.xml) |
| [`calibr-briefing`](podcasts/calibr-briefing/) | Travis Young (Calibr-Skaggs, Scripps) — daily biotech & pharma briefing | [feed.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewsu/ai-nuggets/main/podcasts/calibr-briefing/feed.xml) |

The root `feed.xml` is a symlink to `podcasts/biomedical-agentic-ai/feed.xml`
to preserve that show's original public RSS URL.

After cloning, run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once to activate the
pre-commit feed-XML validator.

## Adding a new show

```bash
python3 scripts/new_show.py my-new-show \
  --title "My New Show" \
  --description "What this show is about" \
  --owner "Owner Name <email>"
```

Then edit `podcasts/my-new-show/PROMPT.md` and `show.toml` to taste, add
the slug to `worker/wrangler.toml` (`ALLOWED_PODCASTS`), and redeploy the
Worker. See `worker/README.md` for Worker setup.
