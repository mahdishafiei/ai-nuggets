# 🦔 AI Nuggets

Personalized podcasts curated and narrated by **Nigel**, an AI assistant.
Each show under `podcasts/<slug>/` is a separate feed for a separate audience.

## Adding a new show

```bash
python3 scripts/new_show.py my-new-show \
  --title "My New Show" \
  --description "What this show is about" \
  --owner "Owner Name <email>"
```

The daily runner (`scripts/run_all_shows.sh`) auto-discovers any
`podcasts/*/PROMPT.md` — no cron edit needed. After scaffolding you
still need to customize the PROMPT/show.toml, allow the slug on the
Worker, and smoke-test before letting cron take over. See
[ADDING_A_SHOW.md](ADDING_A_SHOW.md) for the full checklist.
